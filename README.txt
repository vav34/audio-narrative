Summary:
This introduction first explains what the Danganronpa series entails as a general guideline of the mainline games in order to familiarize listeners who were not already familiar with the series. A brief explanation of the mechanics and format of the game is addressed. Next contains a brief introduction of the character of focus for this audio narrative--Kokichi Oma. His role in the game as an antagonist is addressed, as well as some key defining features of his character. This sets up the narrative by explaining what I plan to discuss as well as introducing the Danganronpa series as a whole.
